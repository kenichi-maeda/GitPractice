# Currency-Converter
### App using Python

Implemented a currency converter app supporting currencies from more than 100 countries using tkinter. Utilized the Currency Converter API from Rapid API to get information on current currency rates.

You can run this program by putting your key and host number in {} in the code.<br/>
```
headers = {
        "X-RapidAPI-Key": "{your key number}",
        "X-RapidAPI-Host": "{your host number}"
    }
```
